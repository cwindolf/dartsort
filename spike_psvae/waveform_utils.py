For example letâ€™s say we use a Neuropixels probe
and create a channel index for channels which are
<=200um apart from each other. This will be a
(384, n_neighbors)  shaped integer array, where
n_neighbors should be ~40 for 200um.
Then channel_index[i] is an array with 40 integers
containing all of the indices of the neighboring
channels. Since different channels may have different
numbers of neighbors, we need to fill in some gaps in
this array, and those will be filled with the value 384
