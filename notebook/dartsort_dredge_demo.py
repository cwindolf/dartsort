# ## DARTsort initial detection + DREDge motion estimation demo
#
# This notebook demos a pipeline for getting initial spike detection and registration
# running on a Neuropixels dataset (dataset1 from https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/_Imposed_motion_datasets_from_Steinmetz_et_al_Science_2021/14024495?file=26476589)
#
# The recording is loaded and preprocessed using SpikeInterface. If you're working
# on a recording which wasn't made with spikeglx like this one, then you can use
# SpikeInterface's other read_* functions to load it up.
#
# ### Installation + setup
#
# To get everything running, first follow the instructions in the README of this repo
# for setting up an environment and installing `dartsort` with `mamba`. Then,
# `git clone` the dredge repo: https://github.com/evarol/dredge . Once you clone that
# repo, you can install `dredge` with
#
# ```
# $ git clone https://github.com/evarol/dredge
# $ cd dredge
# $ cd dredge-python
# # (make sure your environment is activated)
# $ pip install -e .
# ```
